# Weather-App
This project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to search for real-time weather conditions and a 5-day forecast for any location using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can also save weather data with custom dates to a local SQLite database and perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on stored records.
